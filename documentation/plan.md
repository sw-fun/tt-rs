# tt-rs Implementation Plan

**Full Name**: Cartoon-oriented Talking Programming Application

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for tt-rs, tracking both current progress and future work. The plan supports two implementation strategies:
1. **MVP Path**: Focus on ToonTalk Reborn (2017 jQuery) feature parity first
2. **Full Vision**: Eventually implement all original ToonTalk (1995 C++) features plus new innovations

**Note**: tt-rs is a clean-room reimplementation inspired by the original ToonTalk implementations (not a fork). See the COPYRIGHT file for attribution.

### MVP Priority: Robot Programming

**The core MVP feature is robot training and execution** - the ability to teach a robot by demonstration and have it replay those actions. This is the unique value proposition of ToonTalk and the primary feature for blog/vlog demonstrations.

A complete robot training demo should show:
1. Setting up initial widgets (numbers, boxes)
2. Clicking robot to enter training mode (yellow glow)
3. Performing actions the robot should learn
4. Clicking robot to stop training
5. Providing new input data
6. Watching the robot replay the trained actions

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

| Feature | Status | What's Missing |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Bird/Nest Messaging | ✅ Complete | Hatching, pairing, message delivery all working |
| **Robot Execution** | 🚧 **MVP Priority** | Pattern matching, bindings, watched execution |
| Scales in Boxes | 🚧 Partial | Scales work standalone, not yet in box holes |
| Erasure Levels | 🚧 Partial | Vacuum removes but doesn't create erased patterns |

#### Robot Execution - Next Steps (MVP Critical)

The robot currently records and replays basic actions. To be blog/vlog-ready:

1. **Pattern Matching** - Robot should match input widgets against its trained conditions
2. **Bindings** - Extract values from matched widgets to use in actions
3. **Watched Execution** - Visual highlighting of current action during replay
4. **Multi-Step Programs** - Support for robots with multiple sequential actions
5. **Tutorial** - Step-by-step "Teach Your First Robot" guide

### ❌ Not Yet Started

|---------|----------|-------|
| Bird/Nest Pairing | High | Drop bird on nest to pair them |
| Message Delivery | High | Drop item on bird → delivers to paired nest |
| Pattern Matching | High | Required for robot generalization |
| Workspace Serialization | High | JSON format for save/load (UI done) |
| Bundled Tutorials/Examples | High | See tutorials.md, examples.md, challenges.md |
| Text Explosion | Medium | Drop text on box → individual letters |
| Sensors | Medium | Keyboard/mouse/touch event handling |
| Backside Views | Medium | Widget configuration interface |
| Element Widget | Low | HTML/SVG content |
| Houses/City | Low | Process containers (original ToonTalk) |
| Trucks | Low | Process spawning (original ToonTalk) |
| Bombs | Low | Process termination (original ToonTalk) |

## Medium-Term Roadmap (Iterations 4-9)

### Iteration 4: Puzzle Infrastructure ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Goal**: Enable puzzle/challenge workspaces with verification drop zones.

Based on ToonTalk Classic Puzzles (https://toontalk.github.io/ToonTalk/puzzles/classic/p1.html):

#### 4.1 DropZone Widget ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `tt-rs-dropzone` crate in containers component
- [x] Implement `DropZone` struct with:
  - `label: String` - displayed text (e.g., "I need a box with 1 and 2")
  - `expected` - pattern to match against (stored separately in puzzle JSON)
  - `on_success_message: Option<String>` - message on success
  - `on_success_url: Option<String>` - URL for next puzzle
- [x] Implement drop zone rendering (styled text box with dashed border)
- [x] Visual feedback on hover (highlight when valid drop target)

#### 4.2 Drop Verification ✅ DONE
- [x] Implement hit test for detecting drops on DropZone
- [x] On drop: check if dropped widget matches expected pattern
- [x] Success: green background, checkmark ✓, success message logged
- [x] Failure: red background, X mark ✗, "Try again!" message, shake animation
- [x] Widget bounces back on failure (stays in workspace)
- [ ] Optional: success message or next puzzle URL navigation

#### 4.3 Copy Source for All Widgets (Refactor)

**Note**: We already have `is_copy_source` pattern on Number, Nest, Bird. Extend to Box:

- [ ] Add `is_copy_source: bool` field to `BoxState`
- [ ] Implement `as_copy_source()` builder method for BoxState
- [ ] Update `BoxState::copy()` to reset `is_copy_source` to false
- [ ] Render copy-source boxes with stacked visual (shadow effect)
- [ ] Ensure copy sources work in puzzle workspaces

This uses the existing `CopySource` component from tt-rs-drag, which already:
- Stays in place when dragged from
- Creates copies on click/drag
- Shows stacked visual appearance

#### 4.4 ToonTalk Classic Puzzles (3 workspaces) 🚧 PARTIAL
- [x] `puzzle-fill-box.json` - Puzzle 1: Put 1 and 2 in a box (working!)

- [ ] Keep same URL (stay on puzzle)
- [ ] Optional: confirmation toast "Puzzle reset!"

#### 4B.2 URL-Based Routing (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create `Route` enum (Home, Tutorial, Example, Challenge, Workspace)
- [ ] Implement hash-based routing (`#/tutorial/fill-a-box`)
- [ ] Parse route on page load
- [ ] Update URL when loading puzzle/workspace
- [ ] Listen for browser back/forward (popstate)

- [ ] Browser reload stays on same puzzle
- [ ] Bookmarks work correctly

#### 4B.4 Undo Last Action (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create command pattern for undoable actions
- [ ] Track: PlaceInHole, RemoveFromHole, MoveWidget, ApplyArithmetic
- [ ] Single undo (Ctrl+Z or Undo button)
- [ ] Undo restores previous state

#### 4B.5 "Show Me" Animated Demo (DONE)
- [x] Define `DemoStep` enum (Wait, MoveTo, DragStart, DragEnd)
- [x] Add `demo_steps` field to puzzle JSON format
- [x] Implement animation playback system with demo cursor
- [x] "Show Me" button plays solution animation
- [x] Smooth interpolation for drag movements

#### 4B.6 Hint System (LOW PRIORITY)

- [ ] Track hints revealed per puzzle
- [ ] Visual indicator for available hints

### Iteration 5: Sensors & Events

- Mouse sensor (click, position)
- Touch sensor (mobile support)
- Sensors trigger robot activation

### Iteration 6: Backside & Configuration
- Flip widget to see backside
- Robot backside shows conditions
- Number backside shows operator selection

## Code Quality Maintenance

### sw-checklist Standards
Run `sw-checklist .` before commits. Thresholds:
- Functions: max 50 LOC (warn >25)
- Modules: max 7 functions (warn >4)
- Crates: max 7 modules (warn >4)
- Projects: max 7 crates (warn >4)

### Refactoring Triggers
When approaching limits, split proactively:
- Large function → Extract helper functions
- Large module → Split by responsibility
- Large crate → Extract new crate

See the "Code Quality Refactoring Plan" section at the end for specific guidance.

## Appendix: Code Quality Refactoring Plan

This section tracks specific refactoring needs identified by sw-checklist.

### Priority Refactoring Tasks

| Priority | Issue | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | app.rs is large | Already split into app/, ops/, robot_exec/, widget_item/ modules |
| 2 | help_panel.rs has many functions | Split into basics.rs, advanced.rs |
| 3 | robot.rs has many functions | Split into robot/, types.rs, ops.rs, mutators.rs |
| 4 | scales.rs has many functions | Split into scales/, ops.rs, mutators.rs |

### Completed Refactoring
- ✅ App component modularized (callbacks, render, ops)
- ✅ Help panel split (basics, advanced, messaging)
- ✅ Robot module split (types, ops, mutators)
- ✅ Scales module split (ops, mutators)
- ✅ Box tests split (creation, resize, erased)
- ✅ Bird rendering split from widget_impl
- ✅ Nest rendering split from widget_impl
